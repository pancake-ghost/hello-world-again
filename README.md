# hello-world-again
Just another hello world cause I forgot what I did in the previous one.

Hello Earth, 
It's me, your Alien. I love pancakes and ghosts. I also love talking to my virtual assistants. 
Am curently watching Space X flacon 19 launch. Maybe I will go to space too one day?

I also love cats. 

End of call. Psshhhh....psh... psh...
